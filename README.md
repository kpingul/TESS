# TESS
Threat Extraction and Summarization System - AI-Powered Threat Intelligence Summarizer

## Objective

To create an AI-powered system that extracts, correlates, and summarizes threat reports, news feeds, and other sources into actionable cybersecurity insights, including attack vectors, attack paths, TTPs, and other contextual data, enabling organizations to transition from reactive to proactive security measures.


### Features

**1. Attack Vector Analysis**

* Identify attack vectors from unstructured data (e.g., phishing, misconfigurations, zero-day exploits).
* Provide insights into how threats originate and enter systems or networks.

**2. Attack Path Analysis**

* Map the progression of attacks from initial compromise to impact:
    * Initial Access → Privilege Escalation → Lateral Movement → Data Exfiltration.
* Identify key choke points and opportunities to disrupt the attack sequence.

**3. TTPs Mapping**

* Map threats to the MITRE ATT&CK framework:
    * Tactics (e.g., Initial Access, Execution).
    * Techniques (e.g., Phishing, Command and Control).
* Correlate TTPs with known threat actors or campaigns.

**4. Threat Actor Intelligence**

* Enrich insights with threat actor profiles:
    * Historical campaigns.
    * Preferred attack methods and tools.
    *   Industries and regions targeted.

**5. Risk Scoring and Prioritization**

* Assign risk scores by combining:
    * IoCs, CVEs, and TTPs.
    * Contextual factors like exploitability, frequency, and severity.
* Provide dynamic prioritization for actionable responses.

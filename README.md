# TESS
Threat Extraction and Summarization System - AI-Powered Threat Intelligence Summarizer

## Objective

To create an AI-powered system that extracts, correlates, and summarizes actionable cybersecurity insights, including attack vectors, TTPs, and other contextual data, enabling organizations to transition from reactive to proactive security measures.


### Features

**1. Attack Vector Analysis**

* Identify attack vectors from unstructured data (e.g., phishing, misconfigurations, zero-day exploits).
* Provide insights into how attacks propagate across systems or networks.

**2. TTPs Mapping**

* Map threats to the MITRE ATT&CK framework:
    * Tactics (e.g., Initial Access, Execution).
    * Techniques (e.g., Phishing, Command and Control).
* Correlate TTPs with known threat actors or campaigns.

**3. Threat Actor Intelligence**

* Enrich insights with threat actor profiles:
    * Historical campaigns.
    * Preferred attack methods and tools.
    *   Industries and regions targeted.

**4. Risk Scoring and Prioritization**

* Assign risk scores by combining:
    * IoCs, CVEs, and TTPs.
    * Contextual factors like exploitability, frequency, and severity.
* Provide dynamic prioritization for actionable responses.
